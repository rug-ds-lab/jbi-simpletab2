# jbi-simpletab2
AJBI skin for PmWiki

# Installation
  * create a `jbi-simpletab2` directory in PmWiki's `pub/skins/` directory.
  * Place all files in the `pub/skins/jbi-simpletab2` directory.

# Setup
To use this plugin, it must be enabled in PmWiki's `local/config.php` file. It can be enabled by setting the `skin` variable.
```
$Skin = 'jbi-simpletab2';
```

It could be that the `pub/skins` directory isn't included as a directory where skins are found because the old skin was hosted somewhere else. To enable the folder, precede the setting of the `skin` variable with the following line:
```
array_push($SkinLibDirs, "$FarmD/pub/skins/");
```

# Usage
The first `h1` header of each page is used as the fancy header. As such it's adviced to begin each wiki page with such a header (e.g. `!title`).

The SideBar and TopBar are generated by PmWiki. To match the TopBar from the DS group, use the following content:
```
* [[http://www.rug.nl/ | RUG]]
* > 
* [[http://www.rug.nl/fse/ | FSE]]
* > 
* [[http://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/ | BI]]
